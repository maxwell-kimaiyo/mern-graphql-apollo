#  GraphQL Book List

A Book List including a server and a client.
Server is built with Node, Express & a customized GraphQL server.
Client is built with React & Apollo client.

The idea behind this app was that I wanted to learn all basic and advanced concepts when it comes to GraphQL together with React. This resulted in a great app that can fit very well as a boilerplate and as a inpiration source for upcoming projects.




Run the app locally:

\*server

```
npm install
npm dev
```

\*client

```
npm install
npm dev

Visit http://localhost:3000
```

Remeber to include a .env file with variables
